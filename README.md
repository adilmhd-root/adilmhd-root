## 📄 About Me
I’m Adil Muhammad from Kerala, India — deeply passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and red teaming.  
Currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Computer Applications**, I explore the offensive and defensive sides of security through hands-on labs, CTFs, and real-world attack simulations.  

I love solving complex challenges, breaking systems to secure them, and continuously improving my skills across multiple domains.
